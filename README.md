What's that figure?

Image manipulation / duplication is a surprisingly common type of fraud in science publications. This is a prototype tool for identification and highlighting of duplicate regions in images. Due to browser sandboxing, this is currently limited to hand-alignment of suspect images, followed by a series of simple image computations (subtraction, etc). Future integration of more complex image processing (auto alignment and registration, etc) will require a different approach. Uses Jquery.


(My one and only foray into js.)
